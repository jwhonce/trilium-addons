# trilium-addons

Repository contains scrips that I wrote to enhance trilium-notes for my use.
I published them in hopes they help others and to feedback as I learn JavaScript.

## archiveDoneTask/archiveDoneTask.js

trilium background JavaScript that marks any #task as #archived older then #archivedAgeInDays.

## gistMirror/gistMirror.js

trilium background JavaScript that mirrors #gistUsername 's GitHub Gists to a subtree in trilium-notes anchored at #gistRoot. Use #run to schedule how often to update mirror.

## updateScript/updateScript.py

Future ETAPI script that will import a file's content to a trilium note where note.title matches the file's name.
